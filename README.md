This repository is created as part of tutorial for scraping contents from this [website](https://www.trollandtoad.com) and parsing the contents into CSV.

The project used python as its language and several libraries such as Beautiful Soaps, requests and csv. 

This project primary serves as learning material for the developer to write better code.

If there is any issues or improvement, please open issues in this repository or email me at: muazahmed@graduate.utm.my
